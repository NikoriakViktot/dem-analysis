# DEM Analysis and Validation in the Ukrainian Carpathians

This repository presents a scientific study and practical workflow for evaluating global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in mountainous regions of Ukraine, with a focus on hydrological and hydraulic applications.

## Project Overview

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are the geometric backbone of hydrological modeling, enabling watershed delineation, river profiling, and floodplain simulation. However, DEMs are more than just height grids — they represent a discretized form of the gravitational field that governs how water flows.

In this study, we systematically assess the quality of four publicly available global DEMs:

- **SRTM**  
- **ALOS AW3D30**  
- **Copernicus GLO-30**  
- **FABDEM**

Each model is aligned to the **EGG2015** vertical reference system and validated using high-precision **ICESat-2 ATL08** LiDAR ground returns over the **Bilyi Cheremosh River basin** — a representative mountainous watershed in the Ukrainian Carpathians.

## Objectives

- Align all DEMs to a **unified vertical datum** (EGG2015 / EVRS)
- Validate DEMs against **ICESat-2 ATL08** ground elevations
- Compute **pointwise accuracy metrics**: ME, RMSE, MAE
- Extract and analyze:
  - **longitudinal profiles**
  - **cross-sectional profiles**
  - **terrain derivatives** (slope, curvature, ruggedness)
- Assess **DEM suitability for hydrological and hydraulic modeling**

## Knowledge Gap Addressed

While global DEM evaluations with ICESat-2 exist, few studies focus on:
- the **Ukrainian Carpathians**
- the **hydrological relevance** (e.g., valley shape, slope realism)
- the **need for vertical datum harmonization**

## Scientific Contribution

By integrating DEMs with geoid models and validating against ICESat-2 reference surfaces, this project provides:
- a **new framework** for DEM trust evaluation
- reproducible, geodetically accurate methods
- high-resolution insights for mountain hydrology and terrain modeling
